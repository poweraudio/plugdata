[autofade~] is an automatic fade in/out for multichannel inputs. It responds to a gate control and uses internal lookup tables for 7 different fading curves. A gate-on happens when the last input value was zero and the incoming value isn't. A gate-off happens when the last value was a non-0 value and the incoming value is 0! The maximum gain depends on the gate on level.
